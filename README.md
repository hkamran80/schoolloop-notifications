SchoolLoop Notification System (SLNS)
=====================================

Grades can change quickly and dramatically, and it's often hard to keep track of things. This program will email you whenever your grades change, telling you which grade changed and by how much.

SLNS will check once a minute whether your grades have changed, and if so, email you.

SLNS is run at the command line, like so:

python main.py {schoolloop school prefix} {schoolloop username} {schoolloop password} {destination email address} {sender email address} {sender password} {smtp address}
